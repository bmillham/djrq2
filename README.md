# djrq2
Updated version of the DJ request site djrq using WebCore2.

DJRQ2, a WebCore2 based web site, designed for Ampache with IDJC in mind so DJs can accept requests for songs.

Requirements:
WebCore2
SQLAlchemy
Nginx

DJRQ2 should also works with the older Prokyon database also used by IDJC, and with my djdb tool can be used with a Winamp database.
