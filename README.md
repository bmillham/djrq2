# djrq2
Updated version of the DJ request site djrq using WebCore2.

DJRQ2, a WebCore2 based web site, designed for Ampache with IDJC in mind so DJs can accept requests for songs.

## Requirements:
- WebCore2
- SQLAlchemy
- Nginx
- scrypt *(if scrypt will not install, apt install libssl-dev may be needed)*
- SQLAlchemy-utils
- gitpython

DJRQ2 also works with the older Prokyon database also used by IDJC, and with my djdb tool can be used with a Winamp database.
